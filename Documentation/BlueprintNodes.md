Blueprint Nodes
===============

The FaceFX UE4 Plugin provides serveral Blueprint nodes, which are described here.

All FaceFX Blueprint nodes require a **FaceFX Component** to be wired to their respective **Target** slots. The FaceFX Setup Blueprint node requires the **Skel Mesh Comp** slot to be wired with the **Skeletal Mesh Component** to animate. The **Skel Mesh Comp** is optional for the other FaceFX Blueprint nodes (this is so a single Blueprint can drive multiple FaceFX characters). If it is not supplied, the first one found is used.

Setup
-----

The FaceFX Setup Blueprint node initializes the linked **FaceFX Component** with the linked **Skeletal Mesh Component** and specified **FaceFXActor** asset. It must be called in the **Construction Script** before any other FaceFX Blueprint node.

+ The **Target** slot is required and should be wired to the **FaceFX Component**.

+ The **Skel Mesh Comp** slot is required and should be wired to the **Sekeltal Mesh Component** to animate.

+ The **Asset** property is required and should be set to the **FaceFXActor** asset to be used for animation.

+ The **Is Auto Play Sound** property is optional. When **checked**, the audio associated with the **FaceFXAnim** asset being played will automatically be started at the appropriate time.

+ The **Is Disable Morph Targets** property is optional. When **checked**, FaceFX will not animate any morph targets. When **unchecked**, any morph target on the character that has a matching target name in the specified **FaceFXActor** asset will be animated by FaceFX.
