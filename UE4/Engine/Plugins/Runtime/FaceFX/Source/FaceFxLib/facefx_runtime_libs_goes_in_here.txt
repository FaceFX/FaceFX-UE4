Place your FaceFX runtime libraries in here.

The folder may look like this afterwards:
/FaceFx-0.9.10/facefx.h
/FaceFx-0.9.10/bin/*
/FaceFx-0.9.10/common/*
/FaceFx-0.9.10/tools/*

The default runtime version is 0.9.10 being places in a folder called FaceFx-0.9.10. When you update the version or folder name, please also update the static member "RuntimeFolder" within FaceFxLib.Build.cs. When done rebuild the plugin to link against the new libs.
